    <h1 style="color: rgb(237, 119, 16);display: flex;text-decoration: none;">What is the “Shop Local” Trend?</h1>
    <p style="color: rgb(89, 20, 238);">Shopping local is the act of everyday consumers, like you, making the decision to buy your produce, clothing and day to day items from a local business instead of going to a large retailer.

        Shopping locally is the trendy new way to create a one-of-a-kind neighborhood.
        
        The Shop Local/Shop Small trend has many benefits, such as building relationships within the community and helping support the local economy, all while building a more vibrant and unified society. Really, who doesn’t feel a bit more warm and fuzzy knowing that they’re supporting their neighbors?
        
        When buying from business owners you trust, shopping experiences become more enjoyable because you know where the products are coming from and the people behind the products.</p>

        When you shop locally, many of the goods and services are locally sourced or crafted. This means that many of your pieces are one of a kind and carry a unique story.<br> Handcrafted jewelry, artwork from local artisans, baked goods made with recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation…
        
        Everything has a story to tell – you get to help tell it.
        
        Visiting local shops and restaurants and choosing to spend locally gives you the opportunity to network and befriend your neighbors. Making connections with the people that surround you encourages word-of-mouth marketing and creates the unified community that we all dream of belonging to.
